	<p>The first main graph is the status graph. This shows the overall emissions (measured in CO2e). In our example image below, both gas and electricity emissions are depicted on different axes, however this may not apply to your organisation.</b>

<div class="para_text">
<p>	As you can see from the above graph, there are two main sources of emissions; gas emissions (Red plot line) and electricity emissions (Blue plot line). The scale of the graphs are also illustrated on each of the vertical axes, displaying the value in kW hours.</p> 

<p>	The horizontal axis displays the time period. As you can see this time period refers starts from the <b>1st of January 2010</b> and ends on the <b>3rd of March 2011</b></p>

<p>	If you click and drag the mouse horizontally over a specified area, the graph will automatically zoom in on that specific time period, allowing you to analyse your emissions data more accurately.</p>
