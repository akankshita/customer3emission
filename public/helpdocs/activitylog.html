<p>This section can be accessed by clicking <b>Admin > Activity Log</b> form the main menu.</p>

<p>The activity log is a security feature provided by the e-MissionManager application so as to monitor who is using the application. Whilst you may have multiple users on the system consider the possibility that a particular staff member has left the organisation; you don't want that person to be still able to log into the system and view confidential information.
