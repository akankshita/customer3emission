This page requires you to load the structure of your organisation so the e-MissionManager application will be able to display the data in terms of your organisation. Entering information that doesn't resemble that of your organisation will result in incorrect data being shown.*
</div>
<div class="para_text">
The first thing you will do is enter each premises into the system that you are monitoring emissions for. Once you have entered a new premises in the "New Premises Details" dialog box, it will then appear in the tree diagram on the left. 
</div>
<div class="para_text">
Once this is done you must click on the premises in the tree diagram and then enter the meter group details relating to that premises. In Fig.1 you will see that the first premises is called office block and it has 2 meter groups, Floor 1 & Floor 2. 
</div>
<div class="para_text">
When the meter groups are created you can then add each individual meter using the "New Meter Details" dialog box. This will allow you to assign each meter to each of the meter groups. In the above example <b>floor 2</b> has 2 meters: <b>Canteen B and Server Room</b>. Once all meters, meter groups and premises are added your configuration is complete.
