	Entering Electricity Data
</div>

<div class="para_text">
If you have electricity sources there are two ways of entering the data. This is done manually or by uploading a file containing the data (generally a csv file). If you just have a single value of how much electricity you have used for each month you should enter your data manually. If you have a list of hourly meter readings provided by your utility company or by a smart meter than you should upload a file.
