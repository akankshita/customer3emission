<div class="para_text">
<p>All graphs throughout the e-MissionManager application can be printed and emailed. This feature is extremely useful if abnormalities or irregularities in energy usage are found so they can be addressed by members of the board, different departments, staff etc. </p>

<p>In the top-right of each graph you will see 2 buttons. The left-most button displays the image of a printer and allows the user to print the graph and its contents. The right-most image allows the user to download the image in a variety of formats, so they can be attached to email. </p>

<p>Fig.40 below depicts these buttons</p>
